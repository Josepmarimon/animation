## Image Sources
All images are from Unsplash and are used for demonstration purposes only. In production:
- Users will upload their own images to Supabase Storage
- Demo images use external URLs (not stored in your storage buckets)

## Deleting Demo Users

When you're ready to remove all demo users, execute this SQL:

```sql
-- Delete demo users from profiles table
DELETE FROM public.profiles
WHERE full_name LIKE '%(demo)%';

-- Delete demo users from auth.users table
DELETE FROM auth.users
WHERE email LIKE '%.demo@example.com';
```

Or delete them one by one via the Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication â†’ Users
2. Search for "demo"
3. Delete each user individually

## Notes
- Demo users are marked with "(demo)" in their full_name field
- All demo email addresses end with `.demo@example.com`
- Demo users have `is_public = true` so they appear in the directory
- Images are external URLs from Unsplash (not stored in Supabase Storage)
- Each user has 2 portfolio projects with one marked as featured
